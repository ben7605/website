1. Introduction
Each week, the teacher chooses an activity that will last 2 blocks of lessons (2x45 min). Protocols and tests are thought out to be completed in 1 hour, allowing the teacher time to travel to the playground and an introduction to the day.
The application will be designed so that groups of several students can work at the same time on the same device (tablets or smartphones). Each group will collect a certain number of points by performing different tests and hypotheses. The team with the most points will be awarded a virtual trophy. We hope to keep the playful and
competitive application.
We design this application so that the teacher can have a theoretical and practical support at a time, with a red thread between the different parts, so that students can better understand the interest of each tool.
However, it is also possible for the teacher to use it only once, at any stage of the content, to introduce or exemplify a theme. It is thus possible to juggle between the various protocols and to follow one theme rather than another depending on the interest and knowledge of the students.
We believe that the best time to start activities would be the beginning of March or April. Indeed, the weather is more ready to go out and this is the moment when the fauna and flora wake up. In addition, this allows teachers to have already addressed some theoretical elements, which will facilitate the execution and understanding of the protocols.
According to the PER, several topics and skills will be addressed. In science, the ecosystem (plants, insects, animals) and the cycle of life will be introduced and / or deepened. The whole application is based on the system of the scientific approach. Students will be asked to collect, observe, formulate a hypothesis, test this hypothesis, analyze the test results and then draw a conclusion.

2. Training and use of the 5 senses
Students will have to improve the use of their senses by making a regular statement on the state of the soil. This analysis will precede the comparison, every week, between the different color changes, the development of the flora and the appearance of the fauna.
Thus, from the first arrival on the field, students: 1) take pictures at different scales;
From a point of view and a precise framework, allowing the geo-spatial reproduction, the pupil takes:
• A photo capturing all the terrain,
• The picture of a tree as a whole,
• A photo of a particular element (eg a flower, the root of a tree, a
small or medium-sized stone) and the environment around it, in a circumference of 20 cm.
2) describe the smell and noise of this place and report on the application;
3) identify the temperature of the air and the earth, analyze a possible difference;
4) enter in the application the meteorology of the previous days, informed by the teacher (the natural or human watering of the ground can have an impact on the characteristics of this one during the tests);
5) reflect on man's use of this space (factory, farm, swamp, castle, dwellings, agriculture, etc.) and its impact on his environment.

3. Unfolding
The course takes place on 6 sessions of 1h30. Sessions can be daily, weekly, or irregular. Each week, the teacher begins with "In the previous episode ...", a brief reminder of what was done last week and why. This will give a framework and purpose to the experiments. Students can better progress.
Session 1
This session is theoretical (in class).
[45min] The teacher establishes a link between the theory seen during the year and the usefulness of going to the field and putting the hands "to the ground". It is a question here of transmitting to the students in a rather detailed way the historical context of soils (agricultural revolutions, massive use of pesticides, soil destruction, plowing, etc.) in order to initiate a critical reflection related to the need to better understand this area is soils and their biodiversity.
[45min] After making this link, he introduces the application to students by browsing and showing them a tutorial / video presentation. The students are then divided into 5 groups. Then it would be nice for the teacher to show the plots / land that the students will be studying during the course (the total of 6 weeks). Students can begin to take charge of the application by completing the first part of the study which focuses on the history of the land concerned (place, name of place, if it is the "path of the castle" , there was perhaps a castle at the time, etc.), according to the information given by the professor.
Session 2
That's it ! We leave for the field!
This session represents the first contact with the earth!
[45min] The first part is mostly based on observation. This is the first session where students begin to get used to using their senses to analyze the environment: colors (soil, landscape), smells, temperature, sounds, weather, type of plants, stones. Students will also have to literally put their hands in the ground to make a first observation: earthworms? Smell, color? Roots?
Students will be guided (but not too much) by the application during this process. They will note all their observations.
[45min] The second part of the session is dedicated to the discussion and the formulation of hypotheses. Students discuss with each other and with the teacher by comparing their results. Using the theoretical content provided by the application and the observations made, the students will make assumptions about:
3
• Why is this land like this?
• Why does he have this color?
• Why is this noise, or why the absence of an expected noise (singing of
birds) ?
• What kinds of insects are present in the earth?
• What kinds of plants are present and why?
• What would happen if ...?
The hypotheses direct the rest of the search. Depending on their interests, students will be able to pursue the study according to three branches / areas of interest: Germination (life cycle), Ecosystem (animals, insects and plants) and Soil structure (composition).
Students write their assumptions about the application.
Session 3, 4, 5 and 6
In order to confirm or refute their hypotheses, students will have to perform one or more protocols (tests). Depending on which branch the students followed, the tests for this session will be different. Of course, students will eventually go through the majority of branches and perform the majority of tests. Indeed, all branches are intrinsically linked; the study of soil and biodiversity must take into account all the different facets of this environment. It is simply a matter of following the interest of the student.
A test corresponds to a session. After each test, the students must discuss, compare their results, discuss, and formulate hypotheses with the content provided by the application and by the teacher. To test these hypotheses, the application will offer students other protocols that they can try at the next session.
• Ecosystem branch
1st test: Students can choose between different routes. If students are interested in insects, they may perform a Barber trap (http://biodiversite.ac-clermont.fr/documents/tech_study/barber sampling.pdf) to determine the composition of terrestrial carabidean communities, which are bio-indicators of the state of ecosystems.
2nd test: If, on the other hand, students are more interested in plants, they can start to identify bio-indicator plants, their number, etc. Spontaneous flora - what are wrongly called "weeds" - is a very good indication of the nature of a field! Simply by agreeing to live there - or not, to be dominant - or very rare, each species is a concentrate of information on the past and present life of a piece of land (https://more.groww.fr/ plants-bio-indicators / and https://www.visoflora.com/index.php?prop201=0&prop4=0&prop6=0&prop7=3&prop8=0 & component = guide & task = identifie & idEG = 59).

• Branch "Soil structure"
If students are interested in the land itself, they can move to the "Soil Structure" branch. The tests to be carried out will be the spade test, the flange test and the "Beer Can Test".
1st test: The spade test is simple, fast and effective. It is simply a case of digging a spade or shovel into the ground about 30 cm deep. Then you have to take out the block of earth and examine it. Several things are worth noting in the app. The number of horizons (different layers of soil), the structure (porous, compact), the size of the aggregates, the difficulty to break these aggregates, the presence or absence of earthworms / roots, etc. Students will then assign a grade from 1 to 5 to the soil sampled on a specific scale (https://www.vd.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/themes/environment/sol/file_pdf/GEO_DE_SOLS_VESS_A_score_chart_EN.pdf). Le test à la bêche permet ainsi d’avoir rapidement une bonne indication de la santé du sol. Le test du boudin, lui, consiste à prendre un peu de terre et la rouler entre ses mains, en essayant de faire un boudin. La forme du boudin indiquera la présence plus ou moins marquée d’argile.
2ème test : L’autre test à réaliser dans cette branche est le « Beer Can test ». Ce protocole permet de déterminer de façon simple mais scientifique le degré de porosité d’un sol, grâce à une cannette vide. Cela donnera aux élèves des indications précieuses qu’ils pourront ensuite utiliser pour formuler leurs prochaines hypothèses.
• Branche « Germination »
Cette orientation est un peu spéciale, dans la mesure où elle va permettre aux élèves d’observer la croissance d’une plante, et donc, le cycle de vie. En effet, une première indication très pertinente de la santé d’un sol c’est tout simplement de savoir si les plantes pousseront dedans. Si elles ne poussent pas, pourquoi ? Terre trop acide ? Trop argileuse ? Trop sableuse ? Toutes ces caractéristiques pourront être déterminées grâce à plusieurs tests. Dans cette branche, les élèves devront tout d’abord ramener en classe une graine et un peu de terre, éventuellement lors de la première sortie.
1er test : Le test du pH est à effectuer en classe. Pour ce test, il faudra faire en sorte qu’une des sessions se déroule en classe pour tous les élèves. Le test du chou rouge a pour but de déterminer précisément le pH d’un sol. Le protocole a suivre peut être trouvé à l’adresse suivante : http://wiki.scienceamusante.net/index.php?title=Jus_de_chou_rouge.
2ème test : Le test du bocal lui, permet d’obtenir la composition du sol, en pourcentage de sable, argile et limon, les trois composantes les plus fréquemment trouvées dans les sols Suisse. Le protocole est disponible à cette adresse : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx8b80PmNE4.
